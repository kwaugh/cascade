We have decided that we're going to pivot to the following two ideas:

1. Try to identify units that can be independently placed on the FPGA (we
believe that Cascade already does this and gives them separate engines), and
then do compilation for each of these separately.
2. Only recompile when the AST changes, rather than when things like program
variables change. This requires stringifying the AST, hashing it, and then
storing the hash in a cache folder. Upon loading a program, if the AST already
exists, then we can grab the bitstream that has already been compiled.
